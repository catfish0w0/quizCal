## the quizCalll App

I have been through a lot of quizzes in my life. Everytime the quiz pops up on Canvas, or any other platforms,
I wonder how it is implemented. So I created one for my own.

### Design Process
The idea is to use an API endpoint provided from a free open sourced test bank to generate quiz questions.
The category of the questions involve Entertainment, Science, History...etc
To change the number of questions and topic on the quiz, you can simply go to the testbank link provided below to generate a new one,
and replace it on App.js.
