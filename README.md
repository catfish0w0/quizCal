## the quizCalll App

I have been through a lot of quizzes in my life.
<br>
Everytime the quiz pops up on Canvas, or any other platforms,
<br>
I wonder how it is implemented. So I created one for my own.

### Design Process

The idea is to use an API endpoint provided from a free open sourced test bank to generate quiz questions.
<br>
The category of the questions involve Entertainment, Science, History...etc
<br>
To change the number of questions and topic on the quiz, you can simply go to the testbank link provided below to generate a new one,
and replace it on App.js.

### Challenges I faced

1. Since we are fetching the questions data from another API, the object fromat received is not as expected as JSON, it contains some HTML entity. To retrieve a human readable object, I have to lookup for library to decode into normal String.
2. The object received has multiple layers. To actually take the data we need for a questions, I have to take the necessary data from the object, and remodel the object as the one format that I needed.
3. have to manage and design multiple state throughout the applications.

### Library I used

- [html-entity](https://www.npmjs.com/package/html-entities)
- [Questions-Bank](https://opentdb.com/api_config.php)
